THIS DONT WORK ON VERSION OF BEAMNG DRIVE - 0.36 and later 
Why the Previous Method No Longer Works

In earlier versions, modifying the global environment using getfenv allowed for interception of functions like deactivateMod. However, with the updates in BeamNG 0.36 and BeamMP, the Lua environment has been secured, and such modifications are restricted to prevent potential exploits and ensure game stability.
